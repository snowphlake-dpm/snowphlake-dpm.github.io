Previous studies reported on the existence of atrophy-based Alzheimer's disease (AD) subtypes that associate with distinct clinical symptoms. 
However, most studies used single-center data, and different approaches, and so the consistency of AD atrophy subtypes across cohorts and approaches uncertain. 
In a large-scale multi-center study we assessed the ability of two methods (Snowphlake and SuStaIn) to detect subtypes consistently in patient populations, 
and if their detected subtypes are consistent with each other.

This webpage contains machine-learning models trained in this large-scale multi-center study [pre-print link], and contains code to use these trained models in other cohorts not included in this study.
